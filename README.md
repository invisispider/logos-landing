working production website with visuals and contact form

🚀 Deploy to Vercel
Let the client preview it (you can even add a custom domain later)
When ready, transfer the project to their Vercel account
(Or have them create a Vercel project and give you access to deploy from GitHub)


The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

2. Roboto-condensed font
3. Changed Layout (section 1, section 2 ...)
4. How hard are we sticking to B/W? Links gray, not blue?
