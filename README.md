## Questions:
1. Image assets: stock assets, avatar image, company logo/icon, product images  
2. Merriweather font  
3. Changed Layout (section 1, section 2 ...)  
4. How hard are we sticking to B/W? Links gray, not blue?  
I feel pretty good about the page. I need to do device testing, and then maybe we should meet up and let me know what you think of the design and layout.
Transferring ownership will have a couple of steps.

I'm somewhat wrapping up the landing page. Now, I need to know how to handle the transfer of ownership professionaly. I'll probably just go over this in person with the client, but I want a template so I know basically how to guide him through it.
1. Formspree - you'll need to create an account. This is a free (for low traffic) service that routes contact form messages to your email

2. Vercel - this is your hosting platform. It should be free until you get some volume or want advanced features.

3. Github - Hmm. I suppose I would just give over ownership of the repo to him? But, does he actually need to be involved with Github for this? Or, if someone else works on the site, they would just contact me or something?

It looks pretty basic, but this is scalable with the best modern technologies - you got a really good custom website for the price.

If you're ever hiring freelancers, be sure to mention this is a Next.js, React, Tailwind and Vercel. These are extremely popular technologies, so you'll have the best supply of freelancer support possible.
